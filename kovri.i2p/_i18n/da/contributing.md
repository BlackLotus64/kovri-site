Kovri is always looking for new developers of all skill levels. Since the code is primarily written in C++, prior knowledge of, and experience with the language is definitely helpful, but we are willing to help teach an motivated individual with a willingness to learn and take direction. If you think you have what it takes or have questions of any kind, pop by the #kovri-dev IRC channel and ask around. We do have lives though, and don't idle by the computer 24/7, so be patient when awaiting a response. Hope to see you there.

Kovri is an initiative with lofty goals, and we realize some individuals with no interest in coding and development may still want to support Kovri's vision for a better future for privacy. We are open to individual of all fields who think they can contribute in a meaningful way. We encourage anyone interested to come by the #kovri IRC channel and share your ideas.

If you feel led to give financially to the development of Kovri, you can give to The Monero Project general fund (Kovri is under the stewardship of the Core Team of the Monero Project).
